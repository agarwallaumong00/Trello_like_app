# Trello_like_app

#### Goal:
- Develop a 'Trello' like application with 'Three Columns'. 
- Columns: TO_DO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE

#### Expectations:
1. User should be able to add/remove a card in any of three columns.
2  Card can be drag and dropped from any column to any another column.
3. Removing a card should affect only the column in which it lies. 
4. Drag and drop within same column should be allowed and order of cards should be maintained.
5. Modular code is expected.

#### Frameworks:
Feel free to use any JS/CSS framework in which you are comfortable.

#### Reference:
You may refer trello.com only as a reference for design. Use your imagination
to enhance the page components further.
